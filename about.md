Rendact is a modern CMS (content management system) that is made to be a static, single page, progressive web application built with React, Redux and Apollo. The first CMS employing the JAM methodology enables us to do more and do it better. Our application can be hosted completely on a CDN as static content for maximum speed, security and reliability.

# Speed

Our world class CDN (content distribution network) has hundreds of servers and automatically serve the application from the closest location to the end user for the lowest latency and highest speed. Our application is an advanced static application which means the code does not change and need to be compiled. A traditional CMS like WordPress can have hundreds of files for its core, theme and plugins which need to be processed every single time the page is visited. Our application requires no server-side processing and is served immediately each page load from the CDN.

# Security

With a static application there is no processing and thus nothing to be hacked. With a traditional CMS there are thousands of security concerns, file permissions, access files, etc. to be concerned about while our application is a vetted, secured, and served directly to the browser.

# Flexibility

All dynamic data and server verification is then done via API's and GraphQL using regional and distributed servers. The front-end application itself is a layer built completely from the data API's which could be used to serve your content to mobile apps or more as you wish.

# Much more

There are many features that this paradigm allows us to bring without any of the traditional drawbacks. Please follow our Social Media pages for more updates.
