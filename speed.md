Rendact is fast. How fast? See some speed tests below via TestMySite, Sucuri and Pingdom's full page test. See our comparison to <a href="/wordpress/">WordPress</a>.

# Explanation

Our world class CDN (content distribution network) has hundreds of servers and automatically serve the application from the closest location to the end user for the lowest latency and highest speed. Our application is an advanced static application which means the code does not change and need to be compiled. A traditional CMS like WordPress can have hundreds of files for its core, theme and plugins which need to be processed every single time the page is visited. Our application requires no server-side processing and is served immediately each page load from the CDN. The CDN itself is optimized with all the best practices for speed, security and reliability for 100% up time and the best performance, period.

Note: This is why you will notice different IP addresses serving the site based on the test server's location as the intelligent CDN serves from the closest point for maximum speed. Our test site is lean but nothing can beat an optimized site served 100% by a world class CDN.

# Time To First Byte (TTFB)

This measures the amount of milliseconds for every step of establishing a connection between the end user and your web server and then receive the first byte of data for the page. This test is independent of the size or efficiency of the actual site and tests the server itself. This is where a CDN will be the most clear winner over monolithic servers which must serve one request at a time, from one location, on one server, etc. to all users around the globe.

#### TestMySite

Scoring a perfect 100 score on the latest protocols and security with SSL, TLS, HSTS, HTTPS, HTTPS2 and valid certificates are the default, even on free accounts with Rendact. Our world class CDN serves every location on this test in 1 or 2 milliseconds!

### Sucuri

Sucuri is a leader in the industry with enterprise grade testing. Scoring a perfect score (A+) on their tests of security and speed of connection from 16 global locations with a speed of ~22 milliseconds.

## Full Page Test (FPT)

This measures the amount of milliseconds for the complete loading of a site for your end user. This is from when the customer presses enter or clicks a link to come to your site vs. when the site is fully loaded. For this test we used Pingdom's four locations around the world and ran each location's test 3 times. Many factors, including Pingdom's own servers and network, come in to play and this gives a very real result for what a user will experience.

The average site on the internet loads in about 3 seconds, while Google recommends under 2 seconds. Google factors your pages load speed in to their algorithm for page ranking in search results, meaning this is important for any site from a blog to a multinational corporation. With consistent results as low as .1 seconds Rendact is in the top 1% of the internet, in speed. Speed, security, and performance previously only available to the largest companies, now available for free with [Rendact.com](https://rendact.com)!
